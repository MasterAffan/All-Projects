# Undercover

Undercover is a social deduction party game built with Flutter. Players are secretly assigned words—most get the same word (civilians), while one or more get a similar but different word (imposters). Players discuss, then vote to find the imposters. The app provides a smooth, engaging experience for in-person play.

## Features

- **Flexible Player & Imposter Count**: Supports 2–20 players and 1–3 imposters (with validation).
- **Word Assignment**: Randomly assigns words to civilians and imposters from a local database.
- **Private Word Reveal**: Each player privately views their assigned word.
- **Discussion Timer**: Built-in timer for the discussion phase.
- **Voting System**: Players vote to identify the imposter(s).
- **Game Results**: Displays the winner and reveals all roles and words.
